They centralize donation collection  of tithes and good will offerings such that about 8% stays back at congregations (based on personal observation as the finance clerk across several congregations and the analogue of dioceses--wealthy congregations would regularly see $25k&#x2F;week from 200 congregants and have a budget of ~$8k annually, but this offset with congregations in less affluent areas). They also have massive economic influence over Utah, surrounding states, and often growing suburbs.<p>They have a very diversified portfolio. As doctrine they take the second coming of Christ seriously and believe they will transform into the world wide government on his return.<p>For the record I left several years ago, but have many family members still heavily involved.

As a Utah native and one who left for my own reasons and still has family in the church, I would say that this statement is completely false. The Mormon church does not practice nor endorse any doctrine relating to shunning or harassment. Just because you left with some personality conflicts and bad terms with members doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Statements like these generally do no good for anyone, and only further radicalize opposing views instead of urging people to engage in an meaningful discussion.",

Jesus replied, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, 19 honor your father and mother,’ and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’” “All these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?” Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”\nMatthew 19:17-26 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage?search=Matthew%2019:17-26&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage?search=Matthew%2019:17-...</a>',

My comment was simply to make a counter-claim to the blanket statement that the church allows no one to leave with dignity.<p>The OP has since shared more details about their personal experience, which was absolutely a terrible experience in every way. It&#x27;s awful that they, and their family, had to go through that. If I feel so awful about it, have I ever attempted to reduce the likelihood of such things happening? Yes! I have.<p>I have also seen people leave the church without any great undue process or negativity—or loss of dignity (in my interpretation of what was meant by dignity).<p>Edit [2]: There has already been more than 1 other person comment, who has left the church, who didn&#x27;t experience any of the negative things that the OP did. That doesn&#x27;t mean that OP is lying, exaggerating, or anything, it&#x27;s simply my point—OP&#x27;s experience is not the universal experience, nor the officially designed experience. Is OP&#x27;s experience more common than it should? Absolutely yes.",

It’s an interesting thought, but I’m not sure how prevalent it is.<p>I have met several general authorities in various capacities (including Bishop Waddell who was quoted in the article). They are humans and suspect to all the frailties that entails, but they have all been serious minded people who take their roles as stewards seriously. I’m sure some amount of fraud or nepotism happens, but I also have a religious view that suggests that whatever wrong is acquired in this life will be corrected in the next.<p>I have known people who have done things with Church money that they shouldn’t have. All of them were excommunicated for the same. The Church takes its financial stewardship seriously with required audits at all levels.<p>I agree with the first half of [2] but not the complaint that follows. It was only recently that more members of the Church lived outside the US. As the Church has grown out of Utah and throughout the US (and outside world) they have done a better job of calling people from more areas.<p>I think this is part of human behavior as well. It can be frustrating, but it’s hard for someone in Salt Lake to know I could serve in capacity X without knowing me personally.

Their profession is about picking out exact details to unpack exact consequences, not being swept along by generalities.<p>The basis of the exemption of churchs is due to the historical development of trusts and revenue law, going back at least as far as the <i>Charitable Uses Act</i> in 1601 -- long before the US Constitution was drafted and adopted. Religious purposes were exempted because at the time genuine belief was common.<p>Charitable purposes as a concept therefore has a shared origin across all of the common law countries, including the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and others.

        '<p>One of my favorite passages from the New Testament is this:<p><pre><code>  Matthew 19:16-30 New International Version (NIV)[1]\n  \n  The Rich and the Kingdom of God\n\n  16 Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing\n  must I do to get eternal life?”\n\n  17 “Why do you ask me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “There is only One\n  who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”\n\n  18 “Which ones?” he inquired.\n\n  Jesus replied, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you\n  shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, \n\n  19 honor your father and mother,’ and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’”\n\n  20 “All these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?”\n\n  21 Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and\n  give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow\n  me.”\n\n  22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great\n  wealth.\n\n  23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for\n  someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. \n\n  24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of \n  a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”\n\n  25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked,\n  “Who then can be saved?”\n\n  26 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God\n  all things are possible.”\n\n  27 Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then\n  will there be for us?”\n\n  28 Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when\n  the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will\n  also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. \n\n  29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother \n  or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as\n  much and will inherit eternal life. \n\n  30 But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.\n\n</code></pre>\nThis is what comes to my mind each time when I hear about people, who call themselves Christians and their love for property.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=Matthew+19%3A16-30&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=Matthew+19%3A16...</a>',

My seminary teacher, the sweetest woman you’ve ever met, got VERY upset and yelled at me when I said that it sounded like Communism. It still sounds a lot like Communism, though.<p>It’s truly amazing that they have 15 years worth of tithing for their members saved up. I have concerns though, when my friends family lives in a house where their youngest kid got lead exposure, and they’re barely getting by, tithing their 10%, but the Mormon church is amassing such wealth yet my friend’s family of five is on food stamps.

When I was unemployed and going through some tough times, even though I’ve never tithed they extended food aid to me. It was a very humbling experience, and if I didn’t have to believe all the stuff Joseph Smith made up I’d probably be an active Mormon. The ingroup exhortations of beliefs that, charitably, are very unlikely, is something I have a very hard time doing, even though quite honestly my life would be better if I was an active Mormon. I have so much respect for all the work Mormons do, though, and think I’m a better person for having grown up with friends in the church.",

Mormons are often the nicest people you&#x27;ll find. It&#x27;s a shame they are expected to express belief in racist, sexist, or other bigoted beliefs in order to be fully acceptable to their in-group.<p>I point out in another comment that, charitably, congregations receive about 8% of donations back to fund local congregations, often several multiples less. Some congregations I saw send about $25k&#x2F;week on average for ~200 congregants, and have an $8k budget (about twice that if you account for mainteance, about about $20k when taking charitable giving of food and bill payment into account). What was most disappointing was the training of how to get people with long term needs off of the congregation&#x27;s dime.<p>I think the Mormon church would do well to adopt a less centralized form of governance, treasury, and cash management.",

I thought that the &quot;Latter Day&quot; in Latter Day Saints referred to the time period of Joseph Smith.  Mormons, from what I understand, encourage each other to prep for the end time and even have a semi-official guide on how to do so(it&#x27;s free and pretty good, actually).  It makes sense to me that they would also want to amass as much resources as possible to eventually build Zion.<p>&gt; I have concerns though, when my friends family lives in a house where their youngest kid got lead exposure, and they’re barely getting by, tithing their 10%, but the Mormon church is amassing such wealth yet my friend’s family of five is on food stamps. Something feels off there.<p>Now I know why virtually all the men in my Mormon friend&#x27;s family and social circle were either surgeons or lawyers.

I have had family who lost jobs and had no money, and the LDS church gave them food and money to cover bills, until they could get back on their feet.

So yes, you can appraise the art and say it would be worth $X millions if sold in the open market, but that&#x27;s entirely against the point of the Church being the custodian of the art.<p>Think of it like a cemetery. That cemetery has a property value, and in a metro area it could be quite high. But the custodians of the cemetery wish to maintain it in perpetuity, and the people who have chosen that cemetery as their final resting place are counting on them to do so. Even if that property could conceivably be sold for a great price, that doesn&#x27;t mean the cemetery custodians are rolling in dough, because they have committed NOT to sell.<p>So if you look at the actual operating budget of the Vatican or any Catholic diocese, you will see that it is relatively modest.

        "<p>I&#x27;m an active Mormon, and I want to try to address a couple of the ideas being discussed on this thread. My purpose is not to change anyone&#x27;s mind, nor is it to defend the LDS church in this particular case (actually I think they&#x27;ve got it quite wrong). Instead, it is to inform people what the culture of the church is like, and maybe if I&#x27;m really successful to help you understand how we can produce members like Clay Christensen on the one hand, and own 2% of Florida on the other.<p>One thing to understand about the LDS church is that the leadership is drawn from the membership, but is really <i>really</i> not representative of that membership. In order to become a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the highest leadership body in the church, you essentially have to have spent decades serving full-time as a church leader at lower levels. This means that all the members of the quorum are old men (and yes, they are all men - that&#x27;s another discussion). We have been accused - correctly - of being a gerontocracy.<p>There are two implications of this. One is that on social issues, the church leadership lags the membership by at least a generation, usually two. Furthermore, the upper membership of the church leads by consensus, ideally unanimous consensus. It takes a long time to get more than a dozen people on the same page about almost anything, much less something like the theological implications of homosexuality (to name one topic of the day). This goes some way to explaining why the leadership keeps getting caught flat-footed when regarding issues of transparency, LGBTQ relations, race, and so on. They aren&#x27;t the internet generation and it shows.<p>But it has a second implication as well. Church leadership often remembers and understands church history completely differently than the lay membership does. In particular, for this issue, in the early part of the 20th century the church nearly went bankrupt. They ended up calling several people with strong business backgrounds to the Quorum of the Twelve, and one of those went on to become President. They managed to put the church&#x27;s finances on a firm foundation. For obvious reasons, none of this tends to get discussed in Sunday School, and most of the membership of the church no longer remembers it. But the leadership most certainly does. In addition, it led to more and more church leaders having business backgrounds instead of pastoral care backgrounds, and as a consequence they tend to view achieving a good ROI on &quot;the Lord&#x27;s money&quot; as being a primary good. I personally disagree, but it is what it is.<p>Next, one thing to note is that none of the church leadership is personally getting rich off of tithing funds. The leadership draws a salary; that salary lets them live comfortably, but it isn&#x27;t 7 figures. Nobody lives in a mansion or flies a private jet. So, then, why are they sitting on an enormous cash pile? In my personal opinion, it isn&#x27;t primarily about the money. It&#x27;s primarily about increasing commitment to the institution. Paying tithing is &quot;faith promoting&quot;. It gives the membership skin in the game. They aren&#x27;t just showing up to a church building for two hours on Sunday. They&#x27;re actively participating in building the Kingdom of God.<p>Of course, you can take the phrase &quot;commitment to the institution&quot; two different ways, depending on your going-in assumptions. For the faithful, building the faith of the membership is a primary good and indeed a principal goal of God. For the skeptical it looks like brainwashing with a nice side benefit of extra cash in the coffers.<p>The next obvious question is, even if you&#x27;re one of the faithful, and you assume that paying tithing is indeed a good way of building a faith community, can&#x27;t they come up with ways of using the money that are more in line with Christ&#x27;s teachings than buying up 2% of Florida? And I wholeheartedly agree. There are. And, of course, owning large tracts of real estate and a mall in downtown Salt Lake City and your own private securities investment firm don&#x27;t make a lot of sense if nobody in the leadership is living like a sheik. So why not spend all of (or at least a lot more of) that cash on charitable works? Why not just go in and rebuild Haiti, or cure cancer, or something?<p>And I honestly don&#x27;t know. I go back to the leadership&#x27;s business background and their recollection of the church nearly going bankrupt, and I can sort of see it... but then I read the Sermon on the Mount, and I can&#x27;t again. I have to chalk it up to a lack of imagination, combined with a loss of pastoral care instincts in the church leadership.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I think it will change... eventually. The time constant of change in the LDS church is something like 20 years, so don&#x27;t expect it to happen tomorrow.<p>Finally, for those of you who have left the church and felt like it tried to take your dignity when you left, I&#x27;m sorry. My wife left, and that wasn&#x27;t our experience. Your experience with the church is almost completely due to the culture and local leadership in your local congregation, and in a lot of cases that can be quite good, but it can also be fairly toxic if you&#x27;re unlucky. I&#x27;ve experienced both, but more of the former. Of course, my experiences don&#x27;t help you if yours are different. I hope you find your peace.",

Our tax code is not perfect but the path forward is to look at it in totality... the minute you try to solve one problem here, you’ll create a dozen there.  Churches are global organizations...

The brief scene between Fred Johnson and a Mormon administrator weighs heavy on the show’s plot but is slipped in between the three main storylines of the  Earth-based United Nations, Detective Miller’s case on Ceres Station and the rag-tag crew currently ship-hopping around the asteroid belt.&quot; etc etc etc",
